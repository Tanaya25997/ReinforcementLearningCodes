1. RL 1: Random algorithm to to estimate J(π) by simulating many of the possible outcomes that might result from running π on an MDP (MDP defined in the main file).  J(π) is defined as the expected discounted
return. We can construct an estimate of J(π), J^(π), by averaging the discounted returns observed across N simulations.

2. RL 2:
